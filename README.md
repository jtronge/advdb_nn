# Advanced Database NN Project

This currently contains an implementation of the IVF Nearest Neighbor searching
algorithm. The current implementation is extremely limited -- it only creates an
inverted index and does no product quantization.

The `bin/` directory contains a couple of scripts for downloading datasets and
running the algorithm.

## Extra Datasets

For getting the SIFT1M datasets: see <http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/>.
